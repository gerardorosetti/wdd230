                <p>
                    In this design, I consider that it is a good Fitt's Law example for the following reasons: all the items in the main menu 
                    of the web page where I can see my projects and the options that I have to access are placed in zones that are easy to get on. 
                    Also, it shows with good size and colors the important options, so the user can easily see those important options and 
                    all these features make a quicker and easier experience for the user.

                <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">udemy.com</a>
                <img src="images/hick.jpg" alt="Hick's Law Example">
                <p>
                    In this design, I consider that it is a good Hick's Law example for the following reasons: Udemy gives a really good 
                    recommendation in general about which course should be the next one that I take, this is by giving the best options 
                    according to the community opinion. Also, it could be according to the content that I have consumed before, 
                    it could be according to my language preferences, etc.. It gives you a lot of help to decide on the options that the website shows you, 
                    making the way the user chooses between the options easier.

                <p>
                    In this design, I consider that it is a good White Space and Clean Design example for the following reasons: GitHub has really good                    
                    spacing between elements, leaving enough white spaces for the user to detail just the important information. Also, it gives                     
                    the user a nice and relaxing image that does not tire the user's eyes.
