                        <h1>Paramo</h1>
                        <p>The beautiful paramo of Merida is one of the most precious views you could ever have, but also because of the long territory, the weather and the low temperature that has the place, it is an ideal site to make agricultural investment, especially about agricultural products that need cold places to grow. Also, for its long territory you can have livestock and invest in it. Finally, because of the place's beauty, lots of people go there for tourism, so you can make a tourism investment.</p>

                        <h1>Mountains</h1>
                        <p>This goes with the hand of the paramo. Merida is characterized by having beautiful mountains, and the famous ‚ÄúPico Bolivar‚Äù, ‚ÄúPico Espejo‚Äù, etc‚Ä¶ in ‚ÄúSierra Nevada‚Äù being one of the highest mountains at least in South America. So, a lot of people are interested in visiting these mountains and appreciate their beauty, and because of this, it is the cableway of Merida, being the cableway to reach higher in the world. So, you can make your own business taking advantage of the tons of visitors that Merida has.</p>

                        <p>This is part of the paramo in Merida, but there is something important to mention, and it is that apart from the tourism that this lagoon generates, you need to consider the tons of rivers and lakes you will find, being a big opportunity to have a fishing investment, for example, with a freshwater fish hatchery.</p>
